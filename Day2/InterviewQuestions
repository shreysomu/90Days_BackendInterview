🔹 Why array size is fixed?
Because memory is allocated at compile time (or creation time) as a continuous block.
Resizing requires:
Creating new array
Copying elements
That’s why size is fixed.

🔹 Difference Between Array and ArrayList?
Array	                    ArrayList
Fixed size	              Dynamic size
Faster	                  Slightly slower
Stores primitives       	Stores objects only
No built-in methods	      Many utility methods
ArrayList internally uses an array and resizes when needed.

🔹 Time Complexity of Searching in Array?
Linear Search → O(n)
Binary Search (sorted) → O(log n)

🔹 Can Array Store Objects?
YES.
Example:
String[] names = {"Shrey", "Somu"};
Student[] students = new Student[5];

Arrays can store:
Primitive types
Object references

🔹 What Happens if Index is Out of Range?
Java throws:
👉 ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Example:
arr[10];

🔹 Why Arrays Are Faster Than Collections?
Because:
No resizing
No wrapper objects (for primitives)
Direct memory access
Less overhead

Collections add abstraction + resizing + object boxing.

✅ 5️⃣ THINKING QUESTION
❓ Why Binary Search Cannot Work on Unsorted Array?
Because binary search eliminates half of the array based on comparison.
Example:
Sorted:[2, 5, 8, 12, 20]
If target < mid → go left.
But in unsorted:[12, 2, 20, 5, 8] You cannot decide:
Should I go left?
Should I go right?
Because order is not guaranteed.

🎯 Interview One-Line Answer:
Binary search depends on sorted order to eliminate half of the search space. Without order, we cannot safely discard half.
