# 90Days_BackendInterview

# ✅ DAY 1 — JAVA FOUNDATIONS (ZERO → SOLID)

⏱️ **Time:** ~2–2.5 hours      
🎯 **Outcome:** You understand *how Java actually runs* and can write clean basic programs confidently.
## 1️⃣ How Java Works (40 mins)
## Concepts (must know for interviews)
* What is **JVM**, **JDK**, **JRE**
* How Java code executes ( `.java → .class → JVM`)
* Why Java is platform-independent
## 2️⃣ Java Basics – Hands ON (50 mins)
## Topics
* Variables
* Data types
* Type casting
* Input using `Scanner`
* `if-else`, `switch`
## 3️⃣ Coding (MANDATORY) (40 mins)
  🔹 Program 1: Even / Odd     
  🔹 Program 2: Largest of 3 numbers     
  🔹 Program 3: Simple Calculator (switch case)      
  🔹 Program 4: Print first N natural numbers        
  🔹 Program 5: Celsius → Fahrenheit
## 4️⃣ Interview Questions (20 mins)
1. Difference between **JVM, JDK, JRE**
2. Why Java is platform independent?
3. Is Java 100% object-oriented? Why?
4. What is bytecode?
5. Why `main()` is static?
6. Can we run Java without JDK?

# ✅ DAY 2 — ARRAYS (ZERO → CONFIDENT)

⏱️ **Time:** 2–2.5 hours
🎯 **Outcome:** You can **think + code array problems without panic**
## 1️⃣ Arrays Basics (30 mins)
### Must-know concepts
* What is an array?
* Memory layout (contiguous)
* Indexing (0-based)
* Time complexity of access → **O(1)**
## 2️⃣ Arrays Operations (30 mins)
### Topics
* Traversal
* Insert element
* Update element
* Delete element (logical)
* Reverse array
## 3️⃣ CODING PRACTICE (MANDATORY) (60 mins)
🔹 Problem 1: Traverse an array
Input: [2, 4, 6]      
Output: 2 4 6                 
🔹 Problem 2: Find max & min
     Input: [3, 7, 2, 9]      
     Output:    
      Max = 9    
      Min = 2    
 🔹 Problem 3: Count even & odd numbers       
 🔹 Problem 4: Reverse an array        
     *(Do NOT use extra array first)*         
🔹 Problem 5: Linear Search    
    Input: [5, 3, 9], key = 3    
    Output: Found at index 1     
## 4️⃣ INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (20 mins)
1. Why array size is fixed?
2. Difference between array and ArrayList?
3. Time complexity of searching in array?
4. Can array store objects?
5. What happens if index is out of range?
6. Why arrays are faster than collections?

## 5️⃣ THINKING QUESTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
👉 **Why binary search cannot work on unsorted array?**
Explain in your own words.

## 6️⃣ Mini Challenge (Optional but Powerful)

👉 Rotate array by 1 position (left)       
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [2, 3, 4, 1]
